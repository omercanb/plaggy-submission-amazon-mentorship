/**
 * OK this is for whichever sad fucker has to work on this part with me.
 * We are using Next.js folder/file based routing, which means that
 * file naming is very sensative and prone to exploding if you misspell
 * and routing is directly based on the folders, unless you use (), which
 * just groups them without affecting the route.
 *
 * page.tsx is where you group components that eventually get served to the user
 * so for example this page.tsx is for localhost:3000 directly, however /(auth)/login/page.tsx
 * is for localhost:3000/login. We will modify this most of the time, unless we are doing some
 * wonky shit that is required by most pages and should be checked multiple times, like
 * auth, for example.
 *
 * Those are grouped under providers (similar to context in a regular react project) and are then
 * wrapped around the whole entire project structe in layout.tsx, which is like the entry point
 * for the application.
