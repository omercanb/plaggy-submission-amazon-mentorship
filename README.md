## Plaggy

This is the repository for Plaggy, a plagiarism prevention tool designed to combat plagiarism from AI.

This project was normally worked on inside a GitHub organization with three private repositories.
That is why there are very few commits in this repo.
Those repos can't be made public as they contain .env files with API keys and secrets.
So this repo is a copy of all three repos, put in a folder, with the .env files removed from the backend and frontend repos.

The more detailed Readmes are available under each repository.
